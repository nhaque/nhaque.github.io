                    <p>
                        Currently, MindEdge has a desktop learning platform catered towards community college students. However, the existing product is suffering from lowered student engagement. It does not address the needs of adult learners, which comprise 8%
                        of the student population - not all of them have access to laptops and they find it quite challenging to engage themselves in the learning process when they return to school.
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>How might we design a mobile learning experience that is engaging, easy to use and supportive for adult community college students?

                        <br>
                        <p>To better understand the target audience and the current landscape of edtech, the team and I went through a 4 month long generative research phase which involved going through literary review, conducting cognitive walkthroughs with experts and user interviews. The data accumulated was then visualized as an affinity map for generating high-level insights and models.</p>

                        <h2> <br> Understanding Adult Learners</h2>
                        <br>
                        <p>Adult learners are non-traditional college students who are returning back to education either for a career change, upgrade or to fulfill a personal goal. Usually, they enroll as part-time students since they have full-time jobs and attend to their academic responsibilities during odd hours. They have both personal and professional commitments that drive them away from learning since the current support provided by the community college is not sufficient. Moreover, they often find themselves demotivated since they are unable to track their learning progress as effectively as traditional college students.</p>
                        <h2><br>Current MindEdge Landscape</h2>
                        <br>
                        <p>Currently, the MindEdge product includes a responsive website which is viewable in a cellular format but not user-friendly. Moreover, a major limitation of the platform is that it is nested within a Learning Management System (LMS); hence we had to make sure that the proposed ideas resulting from brainstorming should not share similar features to avoid confusion amongst the target users and unwanted competition between MindEdge and the LMS players.</p>
                        <h2><br>Our Deliverable</h2>
                        <br>
                        <p>Following our research phase, we brainstormed and narrowed our idea(s) list which composed of features that would be part of a personalized mobile application. We adopted an agile format to our design process which lasted for 9 weeks for prototyping and iterations to develop hi-fi prototypes of the final design.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>For more details on our process in arriving at the final design, visit our project website <a href="https://synchronized.team/">here.</a> </p>

                    <h3>DESIGN SYSTEM</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>As the individual features gradually came to life, we built out a design system to ensure consistency and adhere to the MindEdge's brand guidelines.
                        It was also a means for the development team to speed up the feature execution process.</p>

                                The modules for each courses are broken down into smaller pieces - <i>chunks</i> - with each chunk visualized on a card. The chunk consists of (a) instructional content (b) multimedia or (c) practice exercises. Students can keep track of their progress via the progress bar on top. They move onto different chunks by either swiping or clicking on the "continue" button.

                                By offering practice challenges in this mode, students gain an adaptive learning experience and enable learning when they are facing time constraints. Students can later review their previous attempts, see detailed explanations and prioritize the modules that requires more practice.

                    <h3>FINAL THOUGHTS</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    This was a clear case of how "one size fits all" never works out in real world. It was pretty interesting to navigate the edtech landscape and be very closely involved with the development team. I learned that quick and cheap user testing is better than no user feedback; since we did not have access to the client database, we ended up testing with our personal connections instead to help guide our design decisions. I also realized how important the role of a design system is to bridge the gap between designers and developers.
